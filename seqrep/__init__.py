"""
SeqRep - Scientific framework for representation in sequential data.

This package aims to simplify the workflow of **evaluation of machine learning
models**.
It is primarily focused on sequential data. It helps with:

- labeling data,
- splitting data,
- **feature extraction**,
- feature reduction (i.e. selection or transformation),
- running pipeline,
- evaluation of results.

It also allows you to **visualize** each step.

The framework is designed for easy customization and extension of its
functionality.

See the GitHub project page for more details:
